# A wrapper around xterm, rlwrap and bc to turn bc into a somewhat more decent calculator
# While bc uses rlwrap, it nukes the prompt so you can no differ in- from output
# Also this ensures the separator on the numpad is turned into a dot

# funcs.bc and logic.bc are from http://phodd.net/gnu-bc/

# Requires: xterm, rlwrap, bc

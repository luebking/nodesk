# A count-down timer
# Usage: xcountdown [<time> [<scale> [<title> [<action> ["rescue"]]]]]

# <time> is the amount of units to countdown (defaults to 10)
# <scale> is s|econds, m|inutes or h|ours (defaults to seconds)
# <action> is executed when the timeout finishes (and is not aborted)
# passing "rescue" allows you to click the timer to abort it

# Requires
# 1. dzen2
# 2. bc
# 3. printf, sleep

# Fun fact:
# ----------
# The countdown was invented by Fritz Lang to raise tension in the 1929
# silent-movie "Frau im Mond" (rocket launch, yes the NASA copied that and
# much more. The film was a favorite of v. Braun and his team.)
# It's on youtube, rocket scene after ~76 Minutes, lasts 15 minutes or so.
# Go, watch it!

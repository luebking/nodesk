# Set a random wallpaper (to the root window) every 3*n/4+n/2 seconds
# (ie a random time around n ;-)

# Usage:
# 1. rwp <path> [<delay>]
# 2. rwp quit
# 3. rwp skip (if you hit a NSFW wallpaper ;-)
# 4. rwp set path <path>
# 5. rwp set delay <delay>
# 6. rwp set <path> [<delay>]

# Requires:
# 1. feh (to set the wallpaper)
# 2. find (to list the path)
# 3. nice, sleep, wait, read, ... ie. binutils)
